## Example Output Quality

**Instead of generic advice:**
> "This brand should focus on social media marketing and build a strong online presence."

**The skill produces specific strategy:**
> "We leverage Sarah's 2.3M TikTok following (73% women 25-40, $75K+ HHI) with 3 educational posts weekly focused on ingredient science—her highest-performing content category (avg. 185K views vs. 92K for lifestyle content). This positioning aligns with the science-driven beauty segment ($4.2B TAM, 15% CAGR), where we face 25% lower competitor density than clean beauty positioning would enable."

---

## Tone Example

**Bad (Marketing Agency):**
> "Your Q1 revenue target is $250K. Ambitious? Yes. Achievable? Absolutely—if you crush the influencer strategy! You're going to build an incredible brand!"

**Good (VC Memo):**
> "Q1 revenue target: $250K. This assumes 3.2% paid ad conversion rate (industry median: 2.8-3.5%) and successful influencer seeding execution in Month 3. Downside scenario: If conversion underperforms at 2.5%, revenue falls to $195K. Mitigation: We allocate 15% of ad budget to CRO testing in Month 2, with weekly performance reviews via WavelaunchOS CRM to detect underperformance by Week 2."

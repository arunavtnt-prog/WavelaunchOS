1. Design Inspiration & Style
What aesthetic are you going for? Please share:

# I added dashboard.png, and a folder named 'shadcn' in which there are documentation of some sections. read all, keep in memory, plan and implement accordingly.

BTW I like vercel's design. You will find that dashboard.png resembles that. 

Here is the Github link to shadcn dashboard v4: https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/dd2d8d7eadb58942d4f3452e2ed66d5a7f699445/apps/v4/app/(examples)/dashboard 

One more important task: Create empty sections/pages as you will be able to see in the dashboard.png - we will later develop those. but right now the dashboard feels empty. it should not feel like that. import the whole dashboard look from shadcn so that it looks like dashboard.png.

2. Brand Assets (if you have them)
Do you have:

Wavelaunch logo (SVG) - https://wavelaunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/wavelaunch_1_-1-1.svg

Brand colors (hex codes or palette)? - Keep it black/white/blue. Take blue theme from shadcn.
Fonts (if specific ones are required)? - Use Geist font. 

3. Specific Pain Points
What bothers you most about the current UI?

Everything - needs a complete refresh

4. Priority Pages
Which pages should we focus on first? (Rank 1-5)

Dashboard (overview) - 1
Client directory (list) - 4
Client detail page (tabs) - 2
Business plan editor - 5
Settings pages - 3

5. Quick Questions
Do you want glassmorphism/blur effects? NO
Should it feel corporate or startup-cool? Hybrid
Any specific features you've seen elsewhere that you love? No
Do you prefer cards everywhere or more list-based layouts? Both
